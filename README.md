# DevOps Engineer Portfolio Projects

## 1. Multi-Cloud CI/CD Pipeline with Secrets Rotation and Policy Compliance

### Problem
Managing deployments, secrets, and compliance across multiple cloud providers is complex and error-prone.

### Solution
Build a CI/CD pipeline using:
- **GitHub Actions** for workflow automation
- **Terraform** for provisioning AWS and Azure resources
- **Vault** for secrets management with auto-rotation
- **Open Policy Agent (OPA)** for compliance checks
- **Slack + LaunchDarkly** for deployment notifications and feature toggling

### Goals
- Automate deployments to AWS and Azure
- Integrate dynamic secrets management
- Enforce infrastructure policies before deployment
- Implement canary deployments

## 2. Infrastructure Cost Tracker and Optimizer

### Problem
Cloud costs spiral due to unused or underutilized infrastructure.

### Solution
Create a cost monitoring and recommendation system using:
- **Pulumi** or **Terraform** for infrastructure tracking
- **Infracost** for cost estimation
- **Scheduled AWS Lambda** to run scans
- **Grafana dashboard** for visualization
- **Slack alerts** for cost anomalies

### Goals
- Track and display real-time infrastructure costs
- Identify underutilized services
- Recommend shutdowns or scaling

## 3. Self-Healing Kubernetes Cluster for Event-Based Systems

### Problem
Event-driven applications are prone to noise-based failures.

### Solution
Build a resilient Kubernetes environment using:
- **Prometheus + Alertmanager** for metrics
- **KEDA** for event-driven autoscaling
- **Karpenter** for dynamic node management
- **ArgoCD** for GitOps-based deployment

### Goals
- Auto-heal failing microservices
- Scale based on Kafka lag or custom events
- Reduce downtime in event-driven architectures
